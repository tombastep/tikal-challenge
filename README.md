Greetings C-137 residents,

We need your help finding creepy Morty before he can do some evil stuff.

In order to find him, we need you to use the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">Rick & Morty API</a>.

## PART I

Your first lead is to find `The Most unpopular character from Earth C-137`
(The character from the origin “Earth C-137” and appears in as few episodes as possible)

**Tip:** Make as few API calls as possible (there is a good way and a bad way to do it).

**Tip:** Have a look at the data returned from the APIbefore starting to implement.

The output of the report should be a table that contains the following information:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Character name</td>
        <td>{character name}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Origin name</td>
        <td>{origin name}</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Origin dimension</td>
        <td>{origin dimension}</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Popularity</td>
        <td>{episode.length}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## PART II

Please create a bar chart of the popularity (num of episodes is shown on) of 5 given different characters, without using any chart libraries. We do not need to implement the axis, but we
want to see a legend.

Use the following data for the characters:

`[Rick Sanchez, Summer Smith, Morty Smith, Beth Smith, Jerry Smith].`

---

**Requirements:**

-   Make sure you implement the code as performant as you can.
-   Keep code readability in mind!
-   You should use React.</br>

-   Do not use any API wrappers, use the given API directly.
-   Other than that you can use any packages or libraries you want.
-   Submit your solution on Gitlab/Github/BitBucket, etc.
